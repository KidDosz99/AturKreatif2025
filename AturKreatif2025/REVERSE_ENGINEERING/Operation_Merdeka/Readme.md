## Description

There are *many* dates in Malaysia's road to independence. But only **one** opened the gates to freedom.

## Objective

Study the binary, avoid the traps, and find the real date of independence to decode the real flag.

## Hints

- Some Base64 strings are decoys.
- `strings`, `ltrace`, or just a bit of C debugging will help.
