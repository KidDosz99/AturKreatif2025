# Bellcore Blunder
by lalalaila

## Description
Inside a high-security cryptographic lab, researchers were experimenting with optimized RSA decryption using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Everything seemed perfect, until a single miscalculation went unnoticed.
Now, someone outside the lab has access to the faulty output. It's uselessâ€¦ unless you know how to weaponize the mistake.

## Difficulty
Hard

## Hint
CRT helps speed up RSA decryption, but if one result is faulty, the private key might not be so private.
