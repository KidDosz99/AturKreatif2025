# Flowers are Ticking
by lalalaila

## Description
Our local botanist, Dr. Linnaeus always spoke of flowers as keepers of time, but I never cared much for them—until I met his daughter. She moved through the garden with effortless grace, her voice as light as the wind through the leaves. I never knew what to say to her, never quite found the right moment… but perhaps she has given me one now.

One afternoon, she finds me among the blooms, a quiet smile on her lips. She sets several bouquets on the table between us, each flower carefully arranged in pairs.

"These were meant for you," she says, tilting her head slightly. "But words left unspoken fade, just like petals in time. If you wish to answer, you must first learn to read time the way I do."

Then, she steps back, watching—waiting. The message is in my hands now, hidden in the rhythm of blooming flowers.

Will you help me decipher her words and finally give her an answer?

## Difficulty
Medium

## Hint
Dr. Linnaeus has a clock in his garden, but it does not tick—it follows the rhythm of twelve.
