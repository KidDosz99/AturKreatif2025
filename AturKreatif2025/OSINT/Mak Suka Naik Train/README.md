# Mak Suka Naik Train
by lalalaila

## Description
Part 2 of Mak's Misadventures.

From KLIA, Mak took the KLIA Transit to another station to switch over to the MRT line. That part alone cost her RM9.40. “_Laju, tapi mahal sikit_,” she texted.

She then hopped onto the _last_ (last!!) MRT train from that connecting station. The ride to her stop took 41 minutes. Can you figure out where she switched, where she got off and when she got off?
