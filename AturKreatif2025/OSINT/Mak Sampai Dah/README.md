# Mak Sampai Dah
by lalalaila

## Description
Part 3 of Mak's Misadventures.

After the long ride, Mak didn’t waste time. She walked straight to the nearest hotel from the MRT station. She said “_Keluar je station, hotel kat kanan_,” before immediately going radio silent (probably knocked out from the journey).

No GPS, no selfie. Just vibes. Can you figure out where she checked in?

Flag format: `AKCTF25{Hotel_Name}`
If there is common acronym in the hotel fullname, use the acronym.
Use underscores (_) for spaces in the name.
