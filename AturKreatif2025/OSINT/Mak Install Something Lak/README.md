by lalalaila

## Description
Mak: "Why is my phone acting weird after I downloaded this '_battery optimizer_' app? It looked legit!"

She sent you the file hash: `2de70ca737c1f4602517c555ddd54165432cf231ffc0e21fb2e23b9dd14e7fb4`

She doesn’t remember the app’s name, but said it was short and “sounded official”. Can you figure out what app she installed?

Flag format: `AKCTF25{First10CharsMD5_MalwareOtherName.apk}`
Example: `AKCTF25{0123456789_malware.apk}`

The malware's other name is 14 chars long, including `.apk`. Eg: `**********.apk`
