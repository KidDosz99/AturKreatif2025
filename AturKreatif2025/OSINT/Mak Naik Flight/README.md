# Mak Naik Flight
by lalalaila

## Description
Part 1 of Mak's Misadventures.

Your mom said she was just going _jalan-jalan kejap_. Next thing you know, she’s on a late-night flight to KL, hopping on trains like she’s in Amazing Race, and checking into a hotel near KLCC.

The only clue she left behind? Her online receipts and some cryptic messages in the family WhatsApp group. Now it’s up to you to piece together her movements.

She left from Bali on 8th April 2025, and landed at KLIA around 10.40 PM. But which flight? And what kind of plane did she board? She mentioned, “_Seat dia sempit sikit tapi okaylah_” before disappearing into the KL night.
