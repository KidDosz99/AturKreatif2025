## Description
Oh, you're here! How wonderful! I've been waiting for you! I just knew you were the right one, you have that spark about you, don’t you? Yes, yes, you do. I’ve got something for you — some broken things, all jumbled up and waiting for someone clever like you to fix them! Can’t you just feel it? It’s going to be amazing!

Now, now, take your time — there’s no rush, no rush at all. Oh, but you might start seeing colours. Colours! Swirling, shimmering, glowing everywhere. It’s almost like they’re alive, don’t you think? So vibrant, so alive, yes... Yes, those colours? They’re the key... to everything.

Ohhh, it’s going to be beautiful. It will all make sense, it will all make sense once you’ve done it right. Go on, go on... I’m right here, just watching... waiting... Just a little longer now... you’re almost there, almost there...

## Difficulty
Hard

## Hint
Oh, right! Right. I forgot to tell you. To restore the fragments, you’ll need a tool that can mend broken pieces. Look for that one crazy box that specializes in repair.
